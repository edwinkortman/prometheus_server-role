### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.4.1.0 version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian environment.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as driver (with [landrush](https://github.com/vagrant-landrush/landrush) plugin) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as provider.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```
- src: idealista.prometheus_server-role
  version: 1.0.0
  name: prometheus
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - role: prometheus
```
